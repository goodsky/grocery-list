# Super List

An application to practice what I've learned about React + Node.

## Tools

Here are the tools I'm using. Consider this an incomplete list since I'll likely forget to update this:

- Concurrently: run multiple npm scripts simultaneously
- Create-React-App: bootstrapping the React frontend project
- ESLint: code quality
- Express: Node.js web host
- Nodemon: host backend during development with hot reloading
- Prettier: code formatting
